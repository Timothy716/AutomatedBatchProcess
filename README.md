# AutomatedBatchProcess
Automation of a batch reaction with a Raspberry Pi.

The main idea is to automate a batch reactor. In the reactor should be a certain pH-value and a specified temperature. The thresholds for both values have to be put in by the operator. To achieve the specified temperature a heater will be used. For the pH-value will be a vinegar solution used. This will be given into the system from a different vessel with a small pump. To have a better understanding of the concept the following process diagram is introduced. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75427181/216032972-6e3054fe-b8a0-4fc9-a6fe-b23e9f53a859.png)
